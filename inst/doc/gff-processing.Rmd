## The problem

Gene Feature Format (GFF) is used to annotate intervals on a genome. Loading
and validating a GFF is a common first step in a bioinformatics analysis.
Mistakes at this step can cause major problems later, so it is important to
validate the GFF and report good diagnostics when problems arise. Here I will
show how such a pipeline can be written using standard methods, and then show
how `rmonad` can be used to organize and annotate such a pipeline.

GFF files are TAB-delimited where each row corresponds to a single interval.
These intervals, though, may be ontologically related. For example a gene is
the parent of an mRNA, which in turn is a parent of a set of exons and a set of
coding sequences (CDS). These relations are specified in the attribute column
(column 9). Here is an example (with TABs replaced with space) that introduces
the main format and the variants we need to support: 

```
# this is a comment, they can appear anywhere in the GFF
# also note, empty lines can appear anywhere in the file

# This is a simple mono-exonic gene
I   .   gene   11565   11951   .   -   .   ID=gene0
I   .   mRNA   11565   11951   .   -   .   ID=mrna0;Parent=gene0
I   .   exon   11565   11951   .   -   .   Parent=mrna0
I   .   CDS    11565   11951   .   -   0   Parent=mrna0

# this is a gene with two splicing variants:
I   .   gene   61931   83591   .   +   .   ID=gene1

I   .   mRNA   61931   83591   .   +   .   ID=rna1;Parent=gene1
I   .   exon   61931   62344   .   +   .   Parent=rna1
I   .   exon   81616   82209   .   +   .   Parent=rna1
I   .   exon   82211   83591   .   +   .   Parent=rna1
I   .   CDS   61931   62344   .   +   0   Parent=rna1
I   .   CDS   81616   82209   .   +   0   Parent=rna1
I   .   CDS   82211   82681   .   +   0   Parent=rna1

I   .   mRNA   61931   83591   .   +   .   ID=rna2;Parent=gene1
I   .   exon   61931   62344   .   +   .   Parent=rna2
I   .   exon   81616   82209   .   +   .   Parent=rna2
I   .   exon   82211   83591   .   +   .   Parent=rna2
I   .   CDS   61931   62344   .   +   0   Parent=rna2
I   .   CDS   82211   82681   .   +   0   Parent=rna2

# Below are a few variants that occur (unforunately) in the wild

# V1: CDS directly descending from a gene.
b   .   gene   7235   9016   .   -   .   ID=gene2
b   .   CDS    7235   9016   .   -   0   Parent=gene2

# V2: 'Parent=-' when feature has no parent
I   .   gene   11565   11951   .   -   .   ID=gene3;Parent=-

# V3: Elements with no tags that need to be treated as IDs
I   .   gene   11565   11951   .   -   .   gene3
I   .   mRNA   11565   11951   .   -   .   ID=mrna3;Parent=gene3
I   .   exon   11565   11951   .   -   .   Parent=mrna3
I   .   CDS    11565   11951   .   -   0   Parent=mrna3
```

Another issues we need to account for is type synonyms. The feature type
(column 3) is required to be valid Sequence Ontology (SO) terms. For the
purposes of this vignette, I will just handle the following sets of synonyms:

 * gene := `gene` | `SO:0000704`

 * mRNA := `mRNA` | `messenger RNA` | `messenger_RNA` | `SO:0000234`
            | `transcript` | `SO:0000673`

 * CDS  := `CDS` | `coding_sequence` | `coding sequence` | `SO:0000316`

 * exon := `exon` | `SO:0000147` | `coding_exon` | `coding exon` |`SO:0000195` 

For mRNA and exon, I am merging to ontology terms (mRNA and transcript; exon
and coding exon). Formally, this is incorrect, but pratically it is probably
the right thing. Since these transformations may be wrong, they need to be
noted.

## Solution

To test our solution, I use the `gff` rmonad dataset.

### Conventional approach

Before using `rmonad`, I will use a more conventional approach.

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(magrittr)
library(rmonad)
set.seed(210)

data(gff)

read_gff <- function(file){
  readr::read_tsv(
    file,
    col_names = c(
        "seqid",
        "source",
        "type",
        "start",
        "stop",
        "score",
        "strand",
        "phase",
        "attr"
    ),
    na        = ".",
    comment   = "#",
    col_types = "ccciidcic"
  )
}

read_gff(gff$good)
```

This is a nice start, also, `readr` will pick up on any deviations from the
specified column number and type, warning of problems:

```{r}
read_gff(gff$invalid_type)
read_gff(gff$not_a_gff1)
```

R uses `NA` to indicate missing values. The R 'numeric' type corresponds to
Haskell `[Maybe Num]`, i.e. an array of possibly empty values. In a GFF,
columns 2,6,7,8 and 9 may be missing, the others may not. So we need an
additional assertion that these are complete.

```{r}
g <- read_gff(gff$good)
for(col in c("seqid", "type", "start", "stop")){
  if(any(is.na(g[[col]]))){
    stop("GFFError: Column '", col, "' may not have missing values")
  }
}
```

Now we need to account for type synonyms

```{r}
gene_synonyms <- 'SO:0000704'
mRNA_synonyms <- c('messenger_RNA', 'messenger RNA', 'SO:0000234')
CDS_synonyms  <- c('coding_sequence', 'coding sequence', 'SO:0000316')
exon_synonyms <- 'SO:0000147'

g$type <- ifelse(g$type %in% gene_synonyms, 'gene', g$type)
g$type <- ifelse(g$type %in% mRNA_synonyms, 'mRNA', g$type)
g$type <- ifelse(g$type %in% CDS_synonyms,  'CDS',  g$type)
g$type <- ifelse(g$type %in% exon_synonyms, 'exon', g$type)

mRNA_near_synonyms <- c('transcript', 'SO:0000673')
exon_near_synonyms <- c('SO:0000147', 'coding_exon', 'coding exon', 'SO:0000195')

if(any(g$type %in% mRNA_near_synonyms)){
    g$type <- ifelse(g$type %in% mRNA_near_synonyms, 'mRNA', g$type)
    warning("Substituting transcript types for mRNA types, this is probably OK")
}

if(any(g$type %in% exon_near_synonyms)){
    g$type <- ifelse(g$type %in% exon_near_synonyms, 'exon', g$type)
    warning("Substituting transcript types for exon types, this is probably OK")
}
```

Now we need to evaluate the attribute column.

```{r}

tags <- c("ID", "Parent")

data_frame(
    attr  = stringr::str_split(g$attr, ";"),
    order = 1:nrow(g)
  ) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(ntags = sapply(attr, length)) %>%
  tidyr::unnest(attr) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(attr = ifelse(grepl('=', attr), attr, paste(".U", attr, sep="="))) %>%
  tidyr::separate_(
    col   = "attr",
    into  = c("tag", "value"),
    sep   = "=",
    extra = "merge"
  ) %>%
  dplyr::filter(tag %in% c(tags, ".U")) %>%
  {
    if(nrow(.) > 0){
      tidyr::spread(., key="tag", value="value")
    } else {
      .$tag   = NULL
      .$value = NULL
      .
    }
  } %>%
  {
    if("Parent" %in% names(.)){
      .$Parent <- ifelse(.$Parent == "-", NA, .$Parent)
    }
    .
  } %>% {
    for(tag in c(tags, ".U")){
      if(! tag %in% names(.))
        .[[tag]] = NA_character_
    }
    .
  } %>%
  {
    if("ID" %in% names(.))
      .$ID <- ifelse(is.na(.$ID) & !is.na(.$.U) & .$ntags == 1, .$.U, .$ID)
    .
  } %>%
  merge(data_frame(order=1:nrow(g)), all=TRUE) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(order) %>%
  { cbind(g, .) } %>%
  dplyr::select(-.U, -order, -ntags, -attr) %>%
  {
    if(all(c("ID", "Parent") %in% names(.))){
      parents <- subset(., type %in% c("CDS", "exon"))$Parent
      parent_types <- subset(., ID %in% parents)$type

      if(any(parent_types == "gene"))
        warning("Found CDS or exon directly inheriting from a gene, this may be fine.") 

      if(! all(parent_types %in% c("gene", "mRNA")))
        stop("Found CDS or exon with illegal parent")

      if( any(is.na(parents)) )
        stop("Found CDS or exon with no parent")

      if(! any(duplicated(.$ID, incomparables=NA)))
        warning("IDs are not unique, this is probably bad")
    }
    .
  }

```

The beauty of this chain is that it requires few temporary variables (just `g`,
and `tags`), it is a pure flow of data. It is an elegant sequence of functions
operating on a single thread of data.

But there are a few problems.

First, it is in dire need of documentation. We could add in comments. But
comments cannot be formatted well. A better approach is some form of literate
programming, such as rewriting the program in Rmarkdown. But this 1) breaks the
pipeline (since we can't pipe between chunks), 2) results in an object we can't
compute on, 3) makes debugging even more difficult, because our code is spread
out. 

### `rmonad` approach

With `rmonad` we can mingle documentation and code in a computable object.

```{r}

read_gff <- function(file, tags){

  raw_gff <- as_monad(
    {

      "
      Rmonad supports docstrings. If an block begins with a string, this
      string is extracted and stored. Python has something similar, where the
      first string in a function is cast as documentation.
      
      The `as_monad` function takes an expression and wraps its result into a
      context. It also handles the extraction of this docstring. The result
      here is used at more than one place in the pipeline. Rather than
      accessing it later as a global, it will be funneled bach in.
      "

      readr::read_tsv(
        file,
        col_names = c(
          "seqid",
          "source",
          "type",
          "start",
          "stop",
          "score",
          "strand",
          "phase",
          "attr"
        ),
        na        = ".",
        comment   = "#",
        col_types = "ccciidcic"
      )
    }
  )

  raw_gff %>>% {

    "
    The %>>% operator applies the function described in this block to the
    input on the left-hand-side. This corresponds to the UNIX '|' or magrittr's
    '%>%'. It differs from them in that it is a monadic bind operator, rather
    than an application operator. It carries a context along with the
    computations. The context can store past values, performance information,
    this docstring, and links to the parent chunk. The context is a directed
    graph of code chunks and their metadata.

    for(col in c("seqid", "type", "start", "stop")){
      if(any(is.na(.[[col]]))){

    failure of this branch triggers failure downstream.

    documentation unit. And perhaps I don't expect it to fail. If I break this
    chunk into several, the failures are more localized, and I can access
    intermediate values for debugging. On the other hand, putting every little
    operation in a new chunk will clutter the graph and reports generated from
    it.

    the cost of high memory usage. For brevity, I won't break this following
    block down any further.

    The `funnel` function packages a list in a monad, merging their histories
    and propagating error. That is, if `gff` or `tags` failed upstream, this
    function will not be run. `%*>%` takes a list on the left and feeds it into
    the function on the right as an argument list. Here `funnel` and `%*>%` are
    used together to merge a pipeline (gff) and inject a parameter (tags).

    We could not have written

      %v>% function(gff=gff, tags=tags)

}

```

That is the whole GFF program in an rmonad framework

```{r}
result <- read_gff(file=gff$good, tags=c("ID", "Parent"))
```

`esc` will extract the final result, and raise all errors, warnings and
messages that where extracted

```{r}
esc(result)
```

Now we see why we might want a little more granularity in our pipeline. To
summarize the results we can use the `mtabulate` functions.

```{r}
mtabulate(result)
```

We can also get a summary of issues

```{r}
missues(result)
```

The `id` column corresponds to a row number in the `mtabulate` result.

To extract particular values, we can use the `get_*` family of vectorized
getters

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# get a list of every stored value, report uncached values as NULL
get_value(result, warn=FALSE)
# get a list of every docstring
get_doc(result)
```

```{r gff-workflow-plot, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
plot(result)
```

A plot of the connections between functions in the pipeline. The node labels
are the `rmonad` ids. The red arrow indicates a 'nest' relationship. Green nodes
are OK, orange nodes raised a warning, red nodes (none appear in this graph)
represent errors.

If the pipeline fails, the last valid result is saved, for example

```{r}
read_gff(gff$not_a_gff1)
```

This makes debugging much simpler. We don't need to jump back and rerun small
parts of the pipeline. The failing object, and all intermediate data, could be
saved. This could also allow for much richer bug reporting.

Overall, in `rmonad`, the output of a pipeline is not just the effluent of the
last pipeline, but the collection of all the nodes along the way. The pipeline
itself becomes data that can be computed upon.
